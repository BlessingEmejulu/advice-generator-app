### What I learned

From this project, I learned to fetch data from APIs using JavaScript, handle promises, work with JSON, and update HTML dynamically. Also, got the hang of event handling, error management, and styling with JS.


### Useful resources

- [How to Call an API in JavaScript – with Examples](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/make-api-calls-in-javascript) - This article on "How to Call an API in JavaScript – with Examples" has been a game-changer for me. It provided clear, step-by-step guidance on fetching data from APIs using JavaScript. The practical examples made it easy to understand, and now I feel more confident implementing API calls in my projects.
